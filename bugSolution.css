The issue is caused by the combination of `justify-content: space-between` and explicit width on the child elements. `space-between` distributes space *between* items, not *around* them. Since the width is fixed to 50%, the last item is pushed to the end.  The solution is to avoid setting the width of the child elements explicitly, or to use a different justification method. Here's a solution that works across different browsers:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}
div > span {
  /*No need to set a width. Let flexbox handle it*/
}
```

Alternatively, consider using `justify-content: space-evenly` which distributes space more evenly.  Note that `space-evenly` distributes space both between items and before the first and after the last item.
